This is a small autoation project that aims to automate the process of going to the online class login page. For eg, during the lockdown period we had online classes . There were a lot of links be it google meet link , zoom links , etc. This application was created using shell script and was run on WSL. 


This application used a main script to run an AWK script that generated a link that it read from a CSV file. The application used system time to find the correct link. All the information regarding timings was arranged in a proper manner in the CSV file.
