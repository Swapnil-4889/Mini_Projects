To create a time table with the starting time in Hrs in the header row and the days of occurance in the first column. This table is described in a controlled language as given below: In this example, one can see that Day-1 and Day-3 can be merged without any overlap of slots. Merging Day-1 and Day-2 leads to a clash of Slot-2 and Slot-3.

Create a weekly course time table for yourself by hand and prepare an image to show it in tabular fashion as above.
Create its description in the controlled language as above and save it as a txt file.
Write a python code that takes the name of this txt file as command line input. The code shall parse the txt file and create a data structure to hold the start and end times of all slots and the days Page 1 of 2they occur on. Consider dictionaries or dataframes for this if needed. The code shall produce an image that shows the table created using this data structure.
Expand the above code to check if any pair of rows can be merged without overlap of slots. One can loop over all possible pairs of rows for this task. When executed, the code will output at least two lines as examples â€“ one line showing which pair of rows can be merged without clash of slots and another line showing which pair of rows leads to clash of which slots.
